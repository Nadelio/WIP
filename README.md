# Window and Interaction Prototype

Various notes:
- JFrames, JPanels, JButtons, and JLabels are getting easier to use and understand now that I have been working with them more frequently
- There is no "center point" for any of the Swing or AWT components, so either I have to make a custom class that adds a center point,
  or align components with respect to their dimensions and the position of their pivot point, which is always in the top left of the component.
- The coloring system is strange, at least, just for the JFrame, you need to get the ContentPlane and change the colors of *that* for the JFrame to change.
  Annoying, but I can see why that may be the case.
- I was unaware that Java had any sort of html capability before this, and now that I know that, I certainly make use of it.
- The majority of components in Java have all kinds of config settings for them, which is awesome, and will certainly be useful for any future projects I have.
